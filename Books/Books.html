        This is one of my favorite books of all time. The book series are very engaging, and most of them can be read on a weekend. It combines the cunnin, ingenuity, and experience of the main character to overcome all the challenges that he faces. It can be very fun for teens and adults.

     <h3>Dungeon Crawler Carl</h3>

        This book is one of the most passionate books I've had the pleasure to listen to. The story of how the main character is struggling to survive as well as plotting something big is intriguing and thrilling to know what's going to happen. This is a great book for young adults and up.

     <h3> The Mayor of Noobtown</h3>

    <p>
        I've had this book for a few months before I really dove deep into it. The start of the book is slow and not really exciting. But as you get more into the chapters, this book shows its true colors. The moral struggle that one can face in their life and the friendship they will create can be unpredictable. The author did a great job of putting sarcasm and humor even in the most challenging obstacle the caravan goes through.
