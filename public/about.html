<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a student currently pursuing an associate degree in network administration. However, my true passion lies in web development, which I discovered in 2024 and have been dedicated to ever since. I have been actively expanding my knowledge and skills in this field, and I am excited to see where this journey will take me.

    In addition to my interest in technology, I am also an experienced photographer with over 4 years of experience. Through both of these passions, I am constantly seeking to improve and challenge myself. I am eager to see how my expertise in both web development and photography will intersect and complement each other in the future.
